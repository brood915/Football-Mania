# Website for Football Fans

```
Allows users to search for league/tournament tables and players' stats, 
and to save them to the local storage so they can see what they want all at once on the same page.

Built with react, redux, and react-router.

[Plans for the future]
# Refactor with redux for all data management
# Add user authentication
# Use express and mongodb instead of local storage
# Find free API for players
# Write algorithms to suggest a player to users
```
