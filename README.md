# Website for Football Fans

```
Allows users to search for league/tournament tables, and players' stats, and save them to the local storage so they can see what they want all at once on the same page.

[[Plans for the future]]
Add authorization
Use express and mongodb instead of local storage
Write algorithms to suggest a player to users
Add a forum
```
