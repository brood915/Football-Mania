# Website for Football Fans

```
Allows users to search for league/tournament tables and players' stats, 
and to save them to the local storage so they can see what they want all at once on the same page.

[[Plans for the future]]
Add user authentication
Use express and mongodb instead of local storage
Find free API for players
Write algorithms to suggest a player to users
```
